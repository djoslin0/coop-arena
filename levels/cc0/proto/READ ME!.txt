Thank you for downloading this collection of free prototyping textures. They were made for designing low poly, retro-style videogames (90s shooters, Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1, and so on). You can use them for any purpose, really.

There are some textures included with this pack which may confuse some people, so I'll explain them here:

Prototype_transparent_32x32px: Just the lines with no colour background. Could be useful for making grids or measuring units in a scene.

Prototype_water_32x32px: Placeholder water texture (until you find or make a better one).

Prototype_trigger_32x32px: A texture used for trigger volumes. For example, a box the player character walks into which closes the door they just passed through, or a cutscene. The Source engine, used to make Half-Life 2, uses a similar texture for trigger volumes. The texture is only for checking where the volume is, making it easier to spot.

Prototype_symbol_no_32x32px: A "no" symbol. No access, no entry, etc. Intended for use as an invisible walls to doorways or areas the player character last visited.

Prototype_symbol_cross_32x32px: A cross symbol. A texture for invisible walls, used to see where the edge of a level is. I recommend using this texture on invisible walls the player cannot cross. For example, the empty space above a wire fence the player might just try to jump over.

Prototype_symbol_skull_32x32px: A skull symbol. A texture for death walls or death floors. For example, if the player falls off the floating island platform, upon touching the volume with the skull on it, die instantly.

Prototype_texture_atlas_32x32px: A texture atlas containing all the textures in a single image. This atlas can be used as a tileset the same way some PlayStation 1 games did.
